# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition
Emerging Technologies 2017 project. Basic [HTML5](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_intro.asp) website using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), [Keras](https://keras.io/), [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/), [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/) & [Ajax](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) technologies.

Emerging Technologies module is part of my [B.Sc. (Hons) in Software Development](https://www.gmit.ie/software-development/bachelor-science-honours-software-development) studies at [Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology](http://www.gmit.ie/)

Instructions for this project were to create a web application in Python, to recognise digits in images, which would enable users to visit the web application through their browser, submit or drow an image containing a single digit. The web application will respond with digit recognition. The web application is to do so using TensorFlow & Flask.

Original set of nstructions for this project can be found [here](https://emerging-technologies.github.io/problems/project.html).

## What is Emerging Technologies Module?
It is a subject to introduce new and emerging technologies in computing. Technologies such as new programming languages, new types of data structures, new types of software infrastructure, and new communications protocols.

## What are it's learning outcomes?
This module is designed to allow individuals to be able to do the following:
* Quickly adapt to new programming languages and styles.
* Discuss and explain proposed new web technology standards.
* Identify new types of applications that can be developed using newly available data infrastructures.
* Utilise new systems and frameworks to analyse data.

## Emerging Technologies is to bring in dept understanding in the following fields:
### 1. Programming languages
  * Comparison of current industry-standard programming languages.
  * Consideration of emerging programming languages and their goals.
  * Quickly learning new programming languages.
  * Programming language selection. 
### 2. Data analysis
  * Comparison of current data analytics infrastructures.
  * Consideration of emerging data analytics infrastructures.
  * Refactoring of data.
### 3. Emerging standards
  * Review of existing web standards and protocols.
  * Introduction to emerging web standards and protocols.

# How to get started
## 1. Downloading necessary software
  * [Python 3.6.3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) **- NOTE -** Ensure python variable is added to your [system path](https://www.google.ie/search?q=how+to+add+python+variable+to+path&rlz=1C1CHBF_enIE770IE770&oq=how+to+add+python+variable+to+path&aqs=chrome..69i57j0.17246j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)!
  
## 2. Install necessary modules/packages for python
Open up command prompt tool of your choice on your system and install the following modules using corresponding commands in your project directory:
  * [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - pip3 install tesorflow
  * [Keras](https://keras.io/) - pip3 install keras
  * [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) - pip3 install numpy
  * [H5py](http://www.h5py.org/) - pip3 install h5py
  * [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - pip3 install flask
  * [Pil](https://python-pillow.org/) - pip3 install pil or pip3 install image
  * **NOTE** - If any other packages happen to not be present while running this project, your console will inform you that certain modules are missing.

## 3. Running the application
All of the bellow commands are for console/ command prompt tool which recognises your python enviroment variable **NOTE** these commands will only work if you are in the project directory.
  * If you wish to run the training model - python train.py
  * If you wish to run the web application - python app.py
  
# Conclusion
Machine learning is certainly really interesting topic when it comes to software development. It is fascinating how machine can do so much computation, analysis and prediction from very little instructions we give it. I definetely see machine learning as innovative future in software development, therefore I will continue thriving for information that there is about machine learning. I will work towards improving my skills and the use the knowlege to perhaps develop something inovative myself.
